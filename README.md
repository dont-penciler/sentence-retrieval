# Sentence Retrieval 

This repository contains source code for my miniproject at the program Viettel Digital Talent 2022: Data Science - Artificial Intelligence specialization.
The goal of this miniproject are: <br>
1. Survey several methods for Sentence Retrieval, including TFIDF, BM25 and Transformer-based methods. Experiment them on both English (SQuAD) and Vietnamese (UIT-ViQuAD) datasets. <br>
2. Finetune language models to improve Sentence Retriever on UIT-ViQuAD dataset. 

The repository is structured as follow:
1. The folder squad1.1 contains SQuAD dataset and methods I implemented (TFIDF, BM25 and some Transformer-based models). I do not finetune models on this dataset.
2. The same as above for folder uit-viquad, but the dataset used is UIT-ViQuAD and I did finetune models on this dataset.
